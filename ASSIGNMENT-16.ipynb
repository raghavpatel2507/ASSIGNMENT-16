    "1.Mean: The mean is the average value of a dataset. It is calculated by summing up all the values in the dataset and dividing the sum by the total number of values. The mean takes into account all the values in the dataset and is affected by outliers. It is commonly used when the dataset is normally distributed and does not have extreme values.\n",

If there is an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values. The median is less influenced by outliers compared to the mean. It is useful when the dataset has outliers or is skewed, as it provides a measure that is less affected by extreme values.\n",

    "These measures help to summarize and describe the central tendency of a dataset in different ways. The mean provides the average value, the median gives the middle value, and the mode identifies the most common value. By using these measures, you can gain insights into the typical values and distribution of the dataset. It's important to consider the characteristics of the dataset and the purpose of the analysis when choosing which measure to use.\n"

    "1.Range: The range is the simplest measure of dispersion. It represents the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. It gives a rough idea of how spread out the values are, but it does not consider the distribution of the data points.\n",
    "Example: Let's say we have a dataset of exam scores: [85, 90, 75, 92, 80]. The range is calculated as the difference between the highest score (92) and the lowest score (75), which is 17. This tells us that the scores in the dataset range from 75 to 92, indicating a spread of 17 points.\n",

    "Example: Consider the dataset of exam scores: [85, 90, 75, 92, 80]. To calculate the variance, we first calculate the mean, which is (85 + 90 + 75 + 92 + 80) / 5 = 84.4. Then we calculate the squared differences between each data point and the mean: [(85 - 84.4)^2, (90 - 84.4)^2, (75 - 84.4)^2, (92 - 84.4)^2, (80 - 84.4)^2]. The sum of these squared differences is 394.16. Finally, we divide this sum by the number of data points (5) to get the variance, which is 394.16 / 5 = 78.83. The variance gives us a measure of the spread of the scores around the mean.\n",

    "Example: Using the same dataset of exam scores, the variance is 78.83. To find the standard deviation, we take the square root of the variance: √(78.83) ≈ 8.88. The standard deviation tells us that, on average, the scores in the dataset deviate by approximately 8.88 points from the mean, giving us a more precise measure of the spread.\n"
